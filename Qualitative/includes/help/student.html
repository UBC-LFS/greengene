<h1>Viewing Progeny</h1>
<p>Once a problem has been assigned to a student, the initial cross will automatically be performed by the system and the initial set of progeny is generated. Once logged in, a student will automatically be directed to the latest cross and will see the progeny associated with that cross.</p>
<p>From the Display Cross selection box located in the toolbar, the user may select the cross number they wish to view. The data for the respective cross chosen will be displayed. A cross header contains the following: the pollen and seed plant for each cross (their traits and phenotypes), and the date and time the cross was performed. All cross headers contain the above information, except for Cross 1 (which is the initial set of progeny), for which this information is intended to be hidden from the student.</p>
<p>For each cross displayed on the screen, the user may click the “+” image next to a particular cross header to expand and show all the progeny for that cross. To hide all the progeny for a particular cross, click the “-“ image next to a particular cross header.</p>
<p>From the Display Cross selection box, the user may also choose to view All. This will display all the crosses performed by the user simultaneously. By default, all the progeny for each cross will be shown. To hide all the progeny for a cross and only display the cross headers, click the Hide All button. Conversely, to show all the progeny for each cross, click the Show All button.</p>

<h1>Performing Crosses</h1>
<p>To perform a cross, the Student must select both a pollen and seed plant. These may be the same plant if desired (i.e. self-pollination), may be two different plants within the same cross, or be two different plants from different crosses.
<p>View the progeny for the cross from which you wish to select either the pollen or seed plant (see Section 4.1 for instructions on how to view progeny). Next to the plant which you wish to use as the seed or pollen plant, click the appropriate Pollen or Seed button. Once the button has been clicked, a rectangular display box (cross display box) will appear at the bottom of your screen which contains the plant information for the pollen or seed plant you just selected. Repeat the above steps to select the second plant for the cross. To change a previously selected pollen or seed plant, simply click appropriate Pollen or Seed button next to the plant and the information in the cross display box will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Once both plants have been selected, click the Perform Cross button on the cross display box. To not perform the cross, click the Cancel button on the cross display box - this will cancel the cross and hide the cross display box.</p>
<p>Only students may perform crosses.</p>

<h1>Exporting and Printing Progeny</h1>
<p>To export progeny data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file, view the progeny you wish to exported (see Section 4.1 for instructions on viewing progeny). Note that the progeny for each cross need not be displayed, but it is essential that the cross header be showing as only these crosses (and their associated progeny) will be exported. Once the desired crosses are displayed on the screen, click the Download Data button. The user will be prompted to download the file. Click Save to save the file to your computer or click Open to open the data in Microsoft Excel directly. Click Cancel to cancel the download operation.</p>
<p>To print the progeny data, have the cross headers for which progeny is to be printed, showing on the screen (see see Section 4.1 for instructions on viewing progeny). Click the Printer Friendly link in the top right hand corner of the screen. A new window will be displayed.</p>
