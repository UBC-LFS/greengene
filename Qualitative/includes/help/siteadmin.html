<h1>Overview</h1>
GreenGene administration is divided between 3 user groups: a Site Administrator, Professors, and TA's. Professors and TA's have the rights to manage their respective courses. However, Site Administrators manage the installation of GreenGene in order to create/delete courses, and manage the Professors/TA's therein.

<h1>Managing Courses &amp; Administrators</h1>
In order to create a course, the Site Admin should click the Create Course button. After entering a course name and description, it is necessary to also pick a User ID, First and Last Name, as well as a Password, for the Professor whom will be primarily responsible for the course.

Each course must have at least one Professor. All Professors will have the same privileges, regardless of the order of creation.

In order to delete a course, select the courses from the Manage Course page by using the checkboxes on the left-side of the list. It is necessary to enter your own Site Administrator password to confirm this deletion as it is an irreversible action.

When a course is deleted, all problems, traits, and associated students and administrators are permanently deleted.

To modify a course, click the Modify button from the Manage Courses page.

From this page, the Site Admin may delete Professors and/or TA's by selecting them using the checkbox, and clicking the Delete button.

The Site Admin may also modify the course name and description. This options are displayed to students when they log into the system.

The Site Admin may modify or create new Professors and TA's for the course. A unique User ID must be entered, as well as first and last names.

Professors may manage all aspects of the course (include problem templates and students), while TA's may only manage students (including assigning problems and viewing their progress).

For further details about the differences between Professors and TA's, see sections 3 and 4.

<h1>Modifying Account Preferences</h1>
The modify my account button enables the Site Admin to change his/her first and last name. This name does not appear to anyone else on the site, other than on the toolbar when logged in as the Site Admin.
